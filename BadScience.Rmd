I will be reading ["Bad Science"](http://www.badscience.net/) from [Ben Goldacre](http://www.badscience.net/about-dr-ben-goldacre/).

I will read one chapter per day and write down from 3 to 5 key bullet points to keep in mind.


## Introduction

As introduction Ben Goldacre tells us the main objective of the book, showing us the **lack of understanding the evidences** in most of the experiments done by scientists and how to not get tricked by them.


## Chapter 1 - Matter

In the first chapter the author brings the purification rituais, for example, some of the detox treatments, he talks about three of them: detox aqua, ear candles and 'hassle barrier'.

1. You have to **question the results**. Just because in the first experiment the water turn brown does not mean it worked. What is in the water? 

2. To have more realistic results you need to have something to **compare**, so it is needed the same experiment twice, with diferent conditions, where one will have the condition experiment and the second as the "controller" or "main model" one.

3. It is important to follow the results when you can not see nothing in the short space of time (like the ear candle experiment).

4. You have to keep in mind: 
+ The experiment's **objective**; 
+ The **methods** used; 
+ **Do not consider** only the results.
